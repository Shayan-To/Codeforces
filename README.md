# Codeforces contest solutions

Add a directory for each contest. Add a class in its own file for each problem. Run the project giving it the mode and the solution. Both mode and solution arguments are optional and case-insensitive, and mode can be given using the initials.

Check `Infra.Config` at the root of the project for other options.
